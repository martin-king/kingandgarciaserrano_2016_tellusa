# kingandgarciaserrano_2016_tellusa

Some scripts I used for King, Garcia-Serrano, 2016, Potential ocean-atmosphere preconditioning of late autumn Barents-Kara sea ice concentration anomaly, Tellus A. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/tellusa.v68.28580

Note that although the scripts were used in the research, the versions stored here may have values for some parameters which are not exactly the same as those used in the research. This is not meant for public distribution, only for my own use or record.
